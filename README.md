Data Science projects through future intern program

# TASK 1
House Price Prediction

Develop a machine learning model using a housing
dataset to predict house prices based on features
like square footage and number of bedrooms.
Preprocess the data to handle missing values and
scale numerical features. Train the model using
regression techniques such as Linear Regression or
Decision Trees. Evaluate its accuracy using metrics
like Mean Squared Error on test data to ensure
reliable predictions. This model aims to assist in
estimating house prices accurately for new
properties.

# TASK 2
Social media sentiment

analysics

Perform sentiment analysis on tweets or Facebook
posts using machine learning techniques. Clean
and preprocess the text data to remove noise and
tokenize the text into meaningful features. Utilize
models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep
learning architectures like RNNs or Transformers to
classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
Evaluate the model's performance using standard
metrics to gauge accuracy and effectiveness in
determining the sentiment of social media posts.
This analysis aims to provide insights into the
overall sentiment expressed in the dataset.

# TASK 3
Employee turnover prediction

Build a predictive model using employee data to
anticipate which employees are likely to leave the
company. Clean and preprocess the dataset,
handling missing values and encoding categorical
variables. Select a suitable classification algorithm
such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
Train the model on historical data to learn patterns
indicative of employee churn. Evaluate the model's
accuracy and effectiveness using metrics like
precision and recall to aid in proactive employee
retention strategies.

# TASK 4
Fraud Transaction Detection

Build a machine learning model using credit card
transaction data to detect potentially fraudulent
transactions. Preprocess the dataset by cleaning
data and handling imbalanced classes. Choose a
suitable classification algorithm like Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Train the model on labeled data to learn patterns
indicative of fraud. Evaluate the model's
performance using metrics such as precision, recall,
and F1-score to assess its accuracy in identifying
fraudulent activities and enhancing transaction
security.

Email Spam Filtering

Develop a machine learning model using email data
to automatically detect spam emails. Clean and
preprocess the email text to prepare it for analysis,
including tokenization and feature extraction. Utilize
classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes,
SVM, or neural networks to train the model on
labeled data distinguishing between spam and non-
spam emails. Evaluate the model's effectiveness
using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score to ensure reliable detection of spam. This
model aims to enhance email security by accurately
filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful
messages.
